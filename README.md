> ðŸ“¬ **righttp** - An opinionated easy-to-use functional Fetch API wrapper.

## Why

- Functional and easy-to-use.
- Opinionated with sensible defaults.
- Decreases boilerplate code.
- Less than **1kb** in size.

## Install

Using [npm][npm-install]:

```sh
$ npm install righttp
```

Using [yarn][yarn-install]:

```sh
$ yarn add righttp
```

Build from source:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:sQVe/righttp.git
$ cd righttp/
$ npm install && npm run build
```

**Note:** `righttp` doesn't provide any polyfills for the **Fetch API** or new
**ES6** features to save size for supported enviroments.

## API

**righttp** is available as a CommonJS and ES module.

```js
import righttp from 'righttp'

const ROOT_URL = 'https://foobar.baz'

const run = async () => {
  const characters = righttp(ROOT_URL + '/characters')
  const id = 100

  // Get all existing characters.
  await characters.get()

  // Create our first character.
  await characters.post('', { id, name: 'totoro', awesome: false })

  // Get our character.
  await characters.get(id)

  // Update character awesomeness.
  await characters.put(id, { awesome: true })

  // Remove character.
  return characters.del(id)
}
```

#### `righttp(url, init, options)`

The main factory function that presets information to the returned underlying
method based API.

###### Parameters

- **`url`** (_string_) - The URL to preset to the request.
- **`init`** (_object_) - A fetch init containing any custom settings to
  preset to the request. See [Fetch API][fetch-api] for further details about
  possible options.

  By default set to:

  ```typescript
  {
    headers: {
      Accept: 'application/json',

    },
    method: 'GET',
  }
  ```

- **`options`** (_object_) - An object containing internal options to preset to the request.

  Possible options are:

  - `payloadAs` (_function_) - TODO: Write this.

  - `resolveAs` (_string_) - Resolve response as either `ArrayBuffer`, `Blob`, `FormData`, `JSON`, `Response` or `Text`.

  - `onResponse` (_function_) - TODO: Write this.

  By default set to:

  ```typescript
  {
    payloadAs: x => JSON.stringify(x),
    resolveAs: 'JSON',
  }
  ```

###### Returns

TODO: How should we document the API that it returns?

###### Example

// Examples for the `righttp` "factory".
```

#### `del(url, payload)`

TODO: Write description. Clearly state that this is provided by the factory `righttp` above.
